        <p class="float"> Shigellosis is an infectious, diarrheal disease caused by a group of bacteria called <i>Shigella</i>. It is transmitted via contact with contaminated food, water, surfaces or an infected person. The disease typically resolves in 1 to 3 weeks with the bacteria lasting another two weeks. 
        </p> 
    <p>
            <i>Shigella</i> causes roughly 500,000 cases of diarrhea in the United States each year. Shigellosis is transmitted through contaminated food and water, direct contact with infected individuals, and through contact with the stool of an infected person. Getting just a little bit of the <i>Shigella</i> bacteria into your mouth is enough to cause symptoms. The illness is most commonly seen in child-care settings and schools.
<p><strong>About <i>Shigella</i></strong>
    <br>
    <i>Shigella</i> is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria that is similar in behavior and habitat to Escherichia coli. There are four species of <i>Shigella</i>: <i>Shigella sonnei </i> (the most common species in the U.S.), <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, <i>Shigella boydii</i>, and <i>Shigella boydii</i>. S. sonnei is the most common species of <i>Shigella. S. flexneri</i>: Also causes diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramps, and fever but is often more severe than S. sonnei infection. Inflammation and ulceration of the lower part of the bowel is also common and illness can be prolonged and more severe. S. boydii: Can cause diarrhoeal diseases of varying severity, but mostly are similar to those caused by S. sonnei. S. dysenteriae: This species causes more severe disease than other forms of <i>Shigella</i> with higher death rates. Inflammation and ulceration of the lower part of the bowel occurs in most cases, displaying itself as bloody stools. </p>

            Symptoms are diarrhoea (which is sometimes bloody), abdominal pain and cramps, and fever. Nausea and/or vomiting, loss of appetite, headache or malaise can also occur. Shigellosis is a cause of travelerâ€™s diarrhea, from contaminated food and water in developing countries. Most who are infected with <i>Shigella</i> develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after they are exposed to the bacteria. Priority for NIAID? Estimates on the number of shigellosis cases vary, as many mild cases often are not diagnosed or reported.

    <p>
            A study of major pathogens that caused foodborne disease in the United States mostly from 2000-2008, estimated that approximately 131,000 episodes of acquired foodborne infection with <i>Shigella</i> occurred each year, with 20 percent of these patients requiring hospitalization. 
    </p>     
    <p>    
        The bacterium is named after its discoverer, Japanese scientist Kiyoshi Shiga. The bacteria were discovered over 100 years ago.The illness that is caused by <i>Shigella</i> species is called shigellosis. The illness is classified as a bacillary dysentery . An estimated 300,000 cases of shigellosis occurs in the United States each year. Production of the toxins following the ingested of <i>Shigella</i> -contaminated food produces the illness. The illness is characterized by pain in the abdomen, cramps, diarrhea that can become bloody as intestinal cells are damaged, vomiting, and fever. These symptoms typically begin from 12 hours to three days after consuming food that is contaminated with the microorganism. People with shigellosis should not attend school or work whilst ill. Children younger than five, food handlers and healthcare staff should stay at home until 48 hours after their symptoms have stopped. If people in these groups have S. dysenteriae infection, because of the severity of the infection, they should stay home until laboratory tests on repeated faecal samples have come back clear. Shigellosis results from the attachment of the bacteria to epithelial cells that line the intestinal tract, and the entry of the bacteria into the cells. Within the host cells, the bacteria divide and can then spread laterally to infect other host cells. The interior location of the bacteria protects them from any host immune response or from antibiotics . Additionally, some strains of <i>Shigella</i> produce the toxins that can damage the epithelial cells. The establishment of an infection is easier in people whose immune systems are compromised. For example, shigellosis is a significant problem in those afflicted with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.Women infected with <i>Shigella</i> during pregnancy need to ensure they do not become dehydrated or experience electrolyte imbalances due to diarrhea from the illness. Laboratory testing on samples of faeces from infected patients is used to diagnose shigellosis </p>
