        <h2> Non-specific facts</h2> -
        <p> Worldwide, there are around 165 million cases of shigellosis each year. Upwards of 1 million individuals in developing countries die from a <i>Shigella</i> infection, the majority of which are children under ten years of age. While the bulk of <i>Shigella</i> incidences occur in the developing world, in the United States, there are an estimated 500,000 cases every year. There are several species of the Shigella bacteria including <i>Shigella dysenteriae</i>, <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, <i>Shigella boydii</i>, and <i>Shigella sonnei</i>, the species responsible for roughly 90% of shigellosis cases.

        In 2008, the Georgia Department of Public Health conducted a research into the populations affected by shigellosis.  The results revealed shigellosis cases are fifty-four percent White, thirty -two percent black/African-American, twelve percent Hispanic, and two percent from other ethnicities. The research also revealed a significant disparity in the number of cases reported between people ages one through ten and all other age groups. Common effects of shigellosis are watery stools, mucoid stools, fever, dysentery, vomiting, cramps, and seizures.

         As suggested by the graph, cases if shigellosis in Georgia have been in flux since 1990. In 1990, there were about 700 cases reported. The following year, that number dropped to around 600 and remained at a similar number in 1992. 1993 saw the quantity of cases drop to 500. In 1994, there was a significant spike in the number of cases reported. The figure reached approximately 1,900 cases. A drop in shigellosis cases was reported in 1995 when the figure was almost 1,400. 1996 saw the number of cases dip even further with approximately 1,100 people being infected with the disease. In 1997, the number of people infected rose to an estimated 1,200. In 1998, those affected fell back down to  about 1,100. In 1999, there was a significant decrease in the number of shigellosis instances. That year, there were around 300 cases of shigellosis reported, and the following year, the number remained  the same. In 2001, the number of cases increased to an estimated 800 people. The number increased drastically the next year to around 1,800. 2004 saw the number of cases decline to approximately 700 cases. Similarly, 2005 saw about 700 cases reported  as well. Finally, in 2006, there were an estimated 1,000 cases reported. Based off of past trends in shigellosis cases, in the future, the number of shigellosis cases will continue to cycle between unexpected spikes and troughs.
