Since <i>Shigella</i> are in the feces, only people with active diarrhea who are unable to control their bowel habits should be isolated or placed together only with other children with active diarrhea. Most infected people may return to work or school when their stools become formed provided that they carefully wash their hands after toilet visits.Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent shigellosis. However, you can reduce your risk of getting shigellosis by:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Carefully washing your hands with soap during key times: Before  eating. After changing a diaper or helping to clean another person who has defecated (pooped).If you care for a child in diapers who has shigellosis, promptly discard the soiled diapers in a lidded, lined garbage can, and wash your hands and the child's hands carefully with soap and water immediately after changing the diapers. Any leaks or spills of diaper contents should be cleaned up immediately.Avoid swallowing water from ponds, lakes, or untreated swimming pools.When traveling internationally, follow food and water precautions strictly and wash hands with soap frequently. Avoid sexual activity with those who have diarrhea or who recently recovered from diarrhea.</p>
    <br>
     <p>   
         Wash your hands with soap carefully and frequently, especially after using the toilet.Do not prepare food for others while you are sick. After you get better, wash your hands carefully with soap before preparing food for others. For those who work in healthcare, food service, or childcare facilities should not prepare or handle food for others until their local health department has authorized them to return to work. Improvements in worker sick leave policies and providing adequate hygiene facilities and education for food service workers may prevent shigellosis caused by contaminated foods.  </p>
