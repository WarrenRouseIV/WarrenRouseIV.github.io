    Hello, my name is Kennedy Odiboh. I’m a rising sophomore at Berkmar High School in Lilburn, Georgia. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia to very loving and diligent Nigerian parents. My dream is to attend Vanderbilt University  to major in neuroscience and minor in the biological sciences. As a high school student, I enjoy spending my time looking for ways to better myself and my community. I felt a special responsibility to embark on this project because I have five siblings that I’d do anything for, and I’ve seen panic reside in my mom’s eyes when she cannot figure out what is wrong whenever my siblings and I fall ill. To think that shigellosis could have affected us at any age is upsetting because of the fact that we would have had no way of treating it. I would not wish this upon any member of my community, so that’s why I set out to raise awareness.

        Hello my name is Marc A Lewis a rising sophomore at Stephenson High School. I am 15 years old and am from Decatur Georgia. I aspire to attend University of Alabama and major in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I play Varsity baseball and football for my high school. Currently I am attends Smash Academy where I am learning various things about myself and engineering. The disease we are working on is important to me because it is not known very well and it has a very large impact on our communities especially the lower income communities. I want to bring awareness to everyone because it is that important.</p>
